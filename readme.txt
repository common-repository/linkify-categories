Turn a string, list, or array of category IDs and/or slugs into a list of links to those category archives. Provides a widget and template tag.

== Description ==

The plugin provides a widget called "Linkify Catagories" as well as a template tag, `c2c_linkify_categories()`, which allow you to easily specify categories to list and how to list them. Categories are specified by either ID or slug. See other parts of the documentation for example usage and capabilities.

== Installation ==

1. Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or install the plugin code inside the plugins directory for your site (typically `/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
3. Use provided widget or the `c2c_linkify_categories()` template tag in one of your templates (be sure to pass it at least the first argument indicating what category IDs and/or slugs to linkify -- the argument can be an array, a space-separate list, or a comma-separated list). Other optional arguments are available to customize the output.
4. Optional: Use the "Linkify Categories" widget in one of the sidebars provided by your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if I tell it to list something that I have mistyped, haven't created yet, or have deleted? =

If a given ID/slug doesn't match up with an existing category then that item is ignored without error.

= How do I get items to appear as a list (using HTML tags)? =

Whether you use the template tag or the widget, specify the following information for the appropriate fields/arguments:

Before text: `<ul><li>` (or `<ol><li>`)
After text: `</li></ul>` (or `</li></ol>`)
Between categories: `</li><li>`

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes. The tests are not packaged in the release .zip file or included in plugins.svn.wordpress.org, but can be found in the [plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/coffee2code/linkify-categories/).


== Developer Documentation ==

Developer documentation can be found in [DEVELOPER-DOCS.md](https://github.com/coffee2code/linkify-categories/blob/master/DEVELOPER-DOCS.md). That documentation covers the template tag and hook provided by the plugin.

As an overview, this is the template tag provided by the plugin:

* `c2c_linkify_categories()` : Template tag to display links to each of any number of categories specified via category IDs/slugs. You can customize text to show before and/or after the entire listing, between each category, and what to display (if anything) when no categories are listed.

This is the hook provided by the plugin:

* `c2c_linkify_categories` : Allows use of an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_linkify_categories()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.
